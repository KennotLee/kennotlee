I am trying to **cook up things**
Not really a fan of making WIP projects public especially in early stages but one should be coming up very soon <sup>citation needed</sup>
#### Why are you doing this?
Programming is my side thing
#### Who really are you
I am just an EE student but the beast inside me is a CS student :sob:
